# Script 4 - Log File Analyzer
# Author: Klemens Danny | Reg No: 24BCE10176
# Course: Open Source Software | Slot: [Your Slot]
# Reads a log file line by line and counts how many times
# a keyword appears, then shows the last few matching lines
#
# Usage: ./script4_log_analyzer.sh /path/to/logfile [keyword]
# Example: ./script4_log_analyzer.sh /var/log/messages error

# $1 is the log file path passed when running the script
LOGFILE=$1

# $2 is the keyword, defaulting to "error" if not given
KEYWORD=${2:-"error"}

# this counter will track how many matches we find
COUNT=0

# making sure the user actually gave a file path
if [ -z "$LOGFILE" ]; then

# checking the file exists before trying to read it
if [ ! -f "$LOGFILE" ]; then
    echo "Error: $LOGFILE not found."

# if the file is there but completely empty, no point continuing
if [ ! -s "$LOGFILE" ]; then
